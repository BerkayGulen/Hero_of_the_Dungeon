# Hero of the Dungeon
This project is a simple hack and slash game with several components 
interact with each other. Hero of the Dungeon (HoD) is about a character that 
goes down 16 levels of dungeons to fight the monsters and save as many people 
as possible while returning with valuable items. Our main goal in this project is 
using the concepts of object oriented programming properly.
